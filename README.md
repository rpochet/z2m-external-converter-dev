# Zigbee2MQTT external converter development

Template to create external converters for Zigbee2MQTT in codespace.

The environment is setup to automatically detect the API of [zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters) (and [zigbee-herdsman](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman)).

The editor will:
- make suggestions (with auto-completion)
- offer insights on hover
- follow definition with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>click</kbd> (view typing)
- highlight problems & suggest fixes
- ...and more: https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript

# Codespace

https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/quickstart

The codespace uses [biomejs](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting, with the [same configuration as zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters/blob/master/biome.json). A task is available to check the code: `Terminal` > `Run task` > `npm: check`. The default settings of the codespace will also automatically format on paste and on save.

> [!TIP]
> If a new version of [zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters) is available but your codespace does not yet have it you can run the task: `Terminal` > `Run task` > `npm: update-zhc`. This command also runs on start of the codespace.
